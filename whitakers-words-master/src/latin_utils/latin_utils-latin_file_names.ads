package Latin_Utils.Latin_File_Names
  with Pure
is

   --  In order to port the program LATIN to another system, the file names
   --  must be made consistent with that system.
   --  This package is withed into all units that declare external file names
   --  and its modification should take care of the system dependence of names
   --  Then one needs to copy the ASCII data files on the disk to files named
   --  in accordance with the modified package.
   --  Note that there are some files that take extensions in DOS, and there
   --  is a function that takes those extensions and makes a legal file name.
   --  In other systems this will have to be handled to Create a legal file name

   --  This package can be presented as the first to be compiled, however
   --  the actual need for file mames does not come until deep in the system
   --  Conventionally, the naming is Put off until the file is actually
   --  used, and the name is passed as a parameter from there to the
   --  earlier procedures which call them

   --  The following files are used in the DOS LATIN program and are
   --  DOS legal, names no longer than 8 Characters, with '.' and extension

   --  Single files, that is, that need only the one FULL name, no variations
   --  These files are Input files and may have any name legal in your system
   --  and contain the ASCII information copied from the porting system

   --  These file names are used with extensions (e.g., GEN, SPE, LOC)
   --  for the various dictionaries
   --  The function ADD_FILE_NAME_EXTENSION below is used to Create
   --  a full file name
   --  Note that for DOS they are not complete names (no '.')
   --  but DOS is forgiving and will give it a pass
