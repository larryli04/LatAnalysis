   --  Two DICTLINEs, sorted the same way
   --  Read into memory arrays (because we have so much memory)
   --  Compared for STEMS, PART, FLAGs, (||), MEAN
   --  The difference generated and written to output file
   --  Color coded, if possible

   --  Two DICTLINEs can then be compared and corrections made
   --  A second run with the corrections gives a benchmark
   --  Another exercise some time later produces another difference file
   --  The two difference files are then DIFFed giving the changes
   --  made over time
